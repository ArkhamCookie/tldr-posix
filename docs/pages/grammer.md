### What is Imperative Mood?

<!-- The grammatical mod of a verb indicates the intention and tone of the sentence. -->
The imperative mood is a verb form used to make a demand or to give advice or instructions (e.g., "Slow down!").
Verbs in the imperative mood don’t follow subject-verb agreement.  Instead, they take the infinitive form; verbs like “run,” “look”,  and "go". [^1]
English usually omits the subject pronoun in imperative sentences. [^2]

#### Grammer Modes [^1]
